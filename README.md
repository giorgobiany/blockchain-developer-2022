# blockchain-developer-2022
A project associated with the Blockchain Developer I am taking right now

This is my first GitHub project and literally my first coding experience.
I am a product marketer with 5+ years of experience working in SaaS companies. 
Since 2017, I've been interested in crypto and blockchain tech. For the last few months I've studied a lot about DeFi and now I want to start my own company in DeFi. It's called Stakero, you can watch more about it here: https://stakero.com. To create a remarkable product I went to a blockchain developer course, and now I'm learning how to code in general, and for the blockchain products.

Well,
   Gotta go!
    Looking forward to at least understand the code, but maybe I will make a great developer, who knows! :)
